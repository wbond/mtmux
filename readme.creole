= mtmux: multi-server SSH via tmux =

mtmux uses the [[http://tmux.sourceforge.net/|tmux terminal multiplexer]] to
create a tiled interface with SSH connections to multiple server with input
being sent to all servers. It is useful for administering a handful of servers
in an interactive fashion.

tmux must be installed for this script to function.

== Usage ==

For basic usage, simply pass any number of user@host specifications.

mtmux user@host user@host2 user@host3

=== Saved Groups ===

It is also possible to save groups of servers in files in your ~/.mtmux
directory. Added one user@host per line and call the group by passing the
name of the file to mtmux.

For example, ~/.mtmux/my_servers could contain:

will@example.com
will@dev.example.com

To connect to all servers, simply call:

mtmux my_servers

=== De-synchronizing Input ===

To switch between synchronized and unsynchronized input, press {{{(prefix) m}}}.
Normal tmux shortcuts can be used to navigate between panes when using
unsynchronized input, {{{(prefix) (arrow keys)}}}.
